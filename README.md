# SpotifyToCSV
Converts the tracks in a Spotify Playlist to a CSV.
Just a little something I built to get all of the songs from a friends playlist.

<h1> Dependencies </h1>

This project uses <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/"> BeautifulSoup v4.4.0</a> and Python 2.7.4. You must install BeautifulSoup before attempting to run the project. <br>
A simple:
<code>
sudo apt-get install python-bs4
</code>
or
<code>
pip install beautifulsoup4
</code>
should do the trick to install it.
